## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Breakdown:
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Abishek Ghimire, a self-taught developer, tech enthusiast, and machine learning explorer from Nepal.

Right now, I'm fully committed to a personal mission:
ðŸŽ¯ Mastering Machine Learning & AI in 180 Days â€” Live on YouTube.

Every day, I stream my learning journey, tackling one concept at a time and documenting everything â€” from notebooks and notes to project code and daily logs â€” in public, for everyone to learn from and contribute to.

ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Doing
ðŸ§  Studying one ML/AI concept daily (currently on Day 14)

ðŸŽ¥ Streaming study sessions live on YouTube to stay accountable

ðŸ’» Building and sharing projects, code, and practical applications

ðŸ“š Creating a free knowledge base of resources, notes, and examples

ðŸŒ± Growing a community of learners who want to break into ML/AI

ðŸ“¦ What You'll Find Here
Code repositories from my challenge

Daily progress logs and concept explanations

Resources for books, courses, datasets, and tools

Open-source projects and collaborations

ðŸ™Œ Why Iâ€™m Doing This
Learning in public changed everything for me. It keeps me accountable, makes the journey more meaningful, and inspires others to start too.
I believe anyone â€” regardless of background â€” can break into tech and AI with consistency, curiosity, and community.

Letâ€™s learn, build, and grow together.
ðŸ“¬ Reach out, star a repo, or drop by the stream â€” youâ€™re always welcome!
